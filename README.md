# hello-world
Creating first repository
I am a programming newb, currently taking a class online and loving it. I am an artist and musician as well. My pasions include all forms of art, travel, cooking, world cultures, philosophy, languages, and cats! I am always finding new passions in my life and consider myself to be a life long student.
